# Statement on discourse about ActivityPub and AT Protocol

A statement was originally published here, however, we have since received an objections to its publication citing that proper processes were not followed, and therefore it has been taken down and republished on [Emelia's website](https://writings.thisismissem.social/statement-on-discourse-about-activitypub-and-at-protocol/) instead, whilst we seek [community group consensus](https://github.com/swicg/general/pull/48). When Emelia merged the pull request, she had been granted permission to do so by the co-chair of the Social Web CG, and given the number of signatories with various significant contributions to ActivityPub and ActivityStreams, Emelia believed that there was enough agreement to publish.
